Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have set up the basis on my website. I have created the intro page that explains the purpose of the website and also set up the links so the person is able to go to the different pages. I have created 4 pages so far, the intro, de-stressing techniques, satisfying videos, and calming sounds page. On those pages I have added basic information and added the videos and sounds. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

For some of my pages I have to add more information and make the pages look for aesthetically pleasing. I also need to add another pages that gives the users some de-stressing activities. In the original proposal I had hoped to create a page where the user was able to take a quiz and at the end get some suggestions on how to de-stress. This page has not been set up yet and may be modified in the final part. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The only problem I have encountered is trying to figure out how to add the quiz part of the website. To solve this problem, I plan on replacing this page and adding something else.
