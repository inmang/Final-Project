  <div class="row">

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Hold onto your values</h3>
      <p>What you find value in helps guide your actions. If you stick to your values you will be more content with your decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Do what you love</h3>
      <p> Everyday may not be perfect, but if you spend a little time doing things you find joy in, you will find overall greater happiness</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Don't be afraid to take risks</h3>
      <p> Life is all about making decisions. If you believe you can find greater happiness doing something else, take the risk and go for it. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Live in the moment </h3>
      <p>Try to avoid being fixated on past failures and instead focus on what you learned from them and it can help you in the future. Appreciate what's around you today because you never know when it may be gone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Stop comparing yourself to others </h3>
      <p>Everyone's journey in life is different. People go through different stages at different times and may not even have the same destination as you. Too much competition can lead to jealousy so instead focus on yourself and achieving your own goals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Stop stressing about expectations  </h3>
      <p>Worrying too much about expectation can cause a lot of stress in life. Some things that you can't control may pop up. It's ok to not meet every expectation.</p>
