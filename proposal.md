# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

De-stress website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that gives you activities to do to help de-stress your life. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a website that users can go to if they are feeling stressed. On the websites there will be multiple pages that will offer de-stressing techniques. One page will be a quiz/ flow chart that the user is able to follow and then at the end it will recommend them an activity to do in order to best de-stress. Another page will have a bunch of calming sounds such as rain or ocean noises that the user is able to listen to. Another page will have a bunch of satisfying videos that the user is able to watch in order to de-stress. Another page will also offer some basic life advice and motivation to help the user feel more calm.

Create a website that any user is able to access that will give them a list of activities to do in order to de-stress. Have a page on the website that can play different sounds to categories.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps are learning more features of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will also need to look into how I can make my website public. Also, I will need to gather the videos and sounds that I want to put on my website. I also need to determine how I want my website to be set up and what aesthetic I want to go with.
