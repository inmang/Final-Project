# Final-Project


For my final project I wanted to create a de-stress website that users would be able to go to if they're feeling stressed. Some of the difficulties that I faced was incorporating css into my website in order to make more aestetically pleasing. Also, in the original plan I wanted to make a page where the user was able to take a quiz to find to reason for the stress and then at the end it would give the user a suggestion. This proved to be very difficult coding wise, so instead, I replaced that page with the happiness page were I offer the user techniques to increase their overall happiness.

What I really enjoyed about this project was the chance to create my very own website and organize it the way I wanted to. In the process I learned a lot more about how webpages are created and the coding that goes into including certain elements into a webpage.
