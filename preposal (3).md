## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

One idea I have is a self-help website where the user is given a bunch of suggestions to de-stress. User's will also be able to take a survey about their stress level and then at the end it offers some suggestions on how to de-stress. Another idea I have is an app that allows you to track your mood throughout the day and it also allows your to track your water intake.
